# Il2cppWorkshop
# A WIP opensource mega-tool for modding il2cpp games including deobfuscation, script generation, cloud file sharing, arm hex conversion, and more!
# This is a massive project. Help is greatly appreciated! Feel free to make pull requests or contact me with code or suggestions. Contact User123456789#6424 on discord, and if that doesn't work, try User123456789#8073.
Made in python

# Goals:
- Infinite loop protection: These program has multiple defenses against it getting stuck in infinite loops. There is an error system, where the code checks for errors and can log the error to the console and / or visually display the error, and some errors will cause it to forcefully terminate. There is also a warning system, and a log system so you can find what went wrong. There are debugging tools and live analytics, helping you know when the program is stuck and why. In addition, loops don't just run and delay everything else: Some loops have abort systems, log things, and check if they are stuck in an infinite loop.
- Cloud backup system: Backup the program data to the cloud, so you do not lose your progress / data! Each ip address has their own backup folder. Make sure you do not use a vpn, and you have a static ip address, or this backup will not sync. OR maybe there will be a username and return "Not Done"word or token system. You can choose to manually backup, and automatic backups may be available from time to time, depending on the capabilities of the server hosting.
- Import your own files, or choose from one of the existing ones. Maybe even a cloud system where people can upload files for others?
- Cloud contribution system: Want to help yourself, and others? When you are done with a task, you can choose to upload the result (deobfuscated things, hex values, dump files, gameguardian scripts, etc.) to the cloud. You can upload it with a custom name. After uploading, you can access these files by searching for them in the cloud database - this way you never lose them. Even better, others can also access these files! You can also upload notes files (such as repositories of methods) to the cloud for others to use. You can also upload checkpoints, so everyone can help contribute to big and time-consuming tasks.
- Brute Force Deobfuscation (Comparitive Deobfuscation): A deobfuscation method that works by comparing unobfuscated and obfuscated dump.cs. It finds the class or member etc. by name. Then, it takes the class, and replaces the names and dynamic values with a certain string ('offset','methodname','classname','comment',etc.). This way, things such as data types, params, # of methods and fields, etc. can be compared. It then converts this into lists of methods, and each method has its method type, and the method params. Same is done on fields and class itself. There is a strikes system with a customizable strictness. It can automatically adapt by narrowing down the perfect strictness by moving it up and down and seeing how little results it can get while still getting results (the toggleable smart mode, changeable in settings or function parameters). This method takes a long time.
- String search deobfuscation (Static Elemenet Deobfuscation): This method is faster, simpler, and better. Both are useful though. This method finds unchanging string (such as int,float) by searching strings until it finds one with low occurences (like 300 or less), and it finds the one with the lowest. It can also remove names / dynamic values and replace with a certain string ('offset','methodname','classname','comment',etc.), but then this has to be done on both versions. Then it sees if this comes up in obfuscated. It uses brute force deobfuscation on the resulting classes methods etc. This is done until the right one is found.
- Mutual Name Deobfuscation (Cross Reference Deobfuscation): This deobfuscation method is kind of like string search deobfuscation. It searches for the name you want to deobfuscate and finds other instances of the name, either as parameters in methods, methods with the same name in other classes, or fields with the same name in other classes. It tries to find one of these where the method or class is unobfuscated, or known through previous deobfuscation. Then, it goes to this class and used brute force deobfuscation to find the right method or field.
- Deobfuscation by name: Put in the name of a method, class, field, etc. and the program attempts to deobfuscate it by comparing unobfuscated and obfuscated dump.cs. Make sure you have get_ or set_ in front of some methods! If a method is not the found, the program looks for it with get_, and if still not, it looks for it with set_.
- Finding by name: Put in the name of a method, field, class etc., and the program will try to find more details about it. You can choose what details you want. Details include, fields of class, methods of class, class type, parameter of method, type of field or method, etc. 
- Auto Deobfuscation: Uses brute force deobfuscation to try to deobfuscate as much as it can, all at once. Failed methods and classes etc. try to use other two methods.
- Beebyte deobfuscation: This project has built-in beebyte deobfuscation with GUI thanks to beebyte deobfuscator. It is not as easy to use or reliable!
- AU deobfuscator (Only for mac / linux): This project has built-in deobfuscation with GUI thanks to au deobfuscator. It only works on mac / linux. You need to first dump the game to get the dummy dll, use il2cppinspector to decompile the dll, and get the  il2cpp-types.h and il2cpp-types-ptr.h files. It is not as easy to use or reliable!
- Saves work: The project saves deobfuscated names, files, script workshop sessions, etc. and restores them next time. You can also store things in the cloud, for yourself and others!
- Task close and resume: Time-consuming tasks like deobfuscation will have checkpoints saved every minute. These checkpoints have almost no effect on storage space or speed (they are usually only kilobytes long). They do not fill up your files, as they are in their own folder in the program's data and each checkpoint replaces the previous one's file, rather than deleting it. You can resume from your checkpoint by going to settings. You will automatically be prompted whether you would like to or not when you restart the project (there is a yes, no, and do not ask again dialog). You can also delete these checkpoints, or import checkpoints from others to finish the job for you. You can disable
- Adort button: If you would like to cancel something, click the abort button in the GUI. This will close and save the progress of currently running task.
- Checkpoint button: There is also a button to manually create checkpoints (see task close and resume).
- Hex patching tools: Method to offset, offset to hex, hex to offset, etc.
- Direct hex patching: Directly modify lib files by offset or hex value. You can also replace all hex values that match. You can also use numbers.
- Lib file analysis: Generate hex patch scripts, find hex values, search for numbers and strings, go to offsets, and more in files like libil2cpp. This is basically a hex editor (with GUI!). Inspired by HxD Workshop (HxD Hex Editor).
- Name remover: This features removes all names in dump.cs of unobfuscated and obfuscated. It also removes dynamic things such as offsets. This way, things match up. This is also useful for unobfuscated things, because it removes dynamic things. It can be used for things such as deobfuscating and auto-updating.
- Renamer: Inspired by de4dot, this feature replaces names and / or things like offsets and comments with clearer names. For example, obfuscated functions can be renamed.
- GG script generator: Can generate custom gg lua scripts for things such as hex patch scripts.
- GG Script workshop: UI for making scripts of pieces of scripts such as mod menus and http request.
- Mod menu workshop: UI for generating mod menu code
- Arm hex converter: Convert arm assembly code for hex opcodes for arm64, armv7, and thumb back and forth. Also, have ret values as an option (just type value u want to ret and it generated hex code). You can also convert hex values into numbers (useful for gameguardian).
- Easilly get useful files: Can get files such as metadata, libil2cpp, etc. with root directory and file name. Choose from the list of files and script uses root directory + "pathoffile" to get file.
- GG script encryption / decryption: Can encrypt, obfuscate, decrypt, and decompile gameguardian scripts with multiple methods (unicode, binary, moonsec obfuscator, etc.)
- Live analytics: Data such as progress, memory used, disk space used, etc. You can disable, enable, and expand things in the settings menu.
- Settings menu: Customize how the project works, both behind the scenes and in your face, with features such as keybinds changing, high contrast mode, low memory mode, and more!
- Great GUI: Buttons, sliders, live analytics, and more! There's even a settings menu to customize it!
- Command Line: If you don't like the GUI, you can use the command line version instead!
- Call functions from the project itself: As a third option, you can you can call edit the program yourself and add function calls to the bottom of the code (make sure to un-comment the template and use that).
- Debugging tools: There are special debugging tools such as monitoring variables, when functions are called, etc.
- Warning and error system: A live warning system and an error system, so you know what goes wrong and why. You can dismiss errors, investigate errors, use debug tools in the way the error / warning suggests, and there is an ignore option and a do not show again option.
- 100% Open Source: All the code is clean, open source, and commented. You are free to use pieces of it with credit, modify it, etc.
